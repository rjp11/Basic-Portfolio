		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>Born and bred in Illinois, I didn't stray far for college when I enrolled at Northwestern University. I graduated with a B.S. in Civil Engineering and have worked as a civil engineer since graduating in 2012. My time as a civil engineer has been a roller coaster, but I learned traits and developed habits that are transferable to any field. My ability to focus on the details while not losing sight of the big picture has become one of my biggest strengths.
		</p>

		<p>Northwestern prepared me for life as civil engineer, so I chose to go back when looking to make a career change. I'm currently enrolled in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp to transition out of my current role and into an exciting and growing field. This portfolio highlights some of the skills I've learned in the program, but I recognize this is only the beginning. I have a lot to learn, but I'm willing to work hard to tackle any project thrown my way.</p>
